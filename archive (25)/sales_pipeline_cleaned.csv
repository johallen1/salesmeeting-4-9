Debut Development,Cold,John Allen,"
Location Preference: Southeast United States, anywhere from North Carolina down to Florida. Current warehouse is in Central Florida
DTC Monthly Order Volume: Yes they process roughly 600k units direct to consumer a year, but they are only looking to outsource B2B at the moment.
B2B + Retail Monthly Order Volume: Roughly 200 pallets a month go to retailers which makes up Kehe (15-30), Thrive (80-120), Grove (50-100), Walmart.com (10-20) and then smaller retailers make up the difference each month. To Amazon about 400 pallets are shipped per month
SKUs: 200 SKUS total with 5-10 additional SKUs each year
Storage Requirement: 800-1,000 pallet positions, with the desire to keep it below 75 degrees if possible.
Products they are shipping: Laundry powder and household products, all in pallet quantities
Specialty Storage or Packaging Needs:
- Each FBA case needs a label
- Kehe orders need 2 labels per case
- Walmart.com gets a case label
- Each pallet has a pallet topper
- Kehe, Thrive, and Grove have specs that require either a SO number or a pallet label on each
- Amazon needs 4 pallet labels per pallet
Current Fulfillment Situation: The client is a co-manufacturer in Central Florida that currently handles fulfillment for the brand as well but they are running into issues at scale and as the scope has changed over time, and need to find a 3PL to take over B2B fulfillment as it is damaging some of the relationship with the client when they make fulfillment mistakes.
Timeline: Would like to onboard a 3PL partner before the start of 2025 so they can test out and ensure quality, then ramp up bringing as much business as possible over in 2025 (potentially by end of Q1 2025 for all B2B), with DTC as an option down the line.
Additional Information:
- The co-man has been with the client for many years now, but recently B2B fulfillment has increased in complexity. What used to be only single SKU pallet orders, in full pallet quantities has developed into a combination of single SKU and mixed- SKU pallet orders, along with the need to create pallets based on varying case quantities and SKU profile. So, they are looking for a 3PL to partner with in the Southeast that can initially handle B2B fulfillment and relieve this pain point
- No hazmat
- Seeking strong customer service levels and response times from 3PL partner
- The co-man has not spoken with any 3PLs yet and is asking for directional pricing in advance to get an understanding of costs
- Expectations would be to inbound at a minimum 1 container per day throughout the year based on their current production levels
- All products will come in single SKU loaded on pallets
- Pallets can be in 45, 120, and 300 case quantities depending on the size of the cases
- Pallets typically need to be GMA Grade A, but can also be Grade B from time to time depending on the retailer it is going to

Specialty Storage or Packaging Needs: Our liquids all need sprayers with them. 90% of orders have a sprayer as a secondary pick

Current Fulfillment Situation: Moved to a 3PL in Cincinnati in April who they like (were doing in-house previously). But, their core manufacturer is moving to Florida so looking for something in the Southeast / Central US that is closer to there and also provides better nationwide coverage

Timeline: Within the next six months

Hero Forge,Cold,John Allen,"1. What product(s) will you be shipping? Custom tabletop miniatures, fully custom products

2. How many SKUs? Each product is unique and 1 of 1, so the SKU count is technically infinite

3. Ideal warehouse location(s)? At least one US location (ok with anywhere outside of the PNW) and ideally a Netherlands or Germany location. They do not need to be the same 3PL

4. Special storage or packaging needs? Each miniature comes individually packaged from the manufacturer, and then the package needs to be bubble wrapped (or similar) to send on to the final consumer

5. D2C Monthly order volume? 11,000 orders a month non-peak, considerably more during peak season. Average 1.5 units an order. Currently have about 5,000 backlogged orders from their prior 3PL shutting down as well.

6. B2B Monthly order volume? No

7. Storage requirements? Very minimal, as it is pretty much JIT fulfillment, with the exception of some merch and dice they keep in stock

8. Timeline to find a new 3PL? They are currently working with a 3PL in North Carolina that is antiquated and still working off of spreadsheets, so they don't have a sense of inventory, order updates, and seem like they might not be able to scale with this 3PL. So, they need to have a backup option ready to go asap (by September) if they decide to make a switch. They do not feel comfortable having all of their eggs in one basket with the Charlotte 3P, especially ahead of peak season, and need to have an immediate option if they pull the trigger on switching.

Additional Notes:
HeroForge has been in business for many years now, and from the very beginning worked with a company called Shipways, which just recently went bankrupt in July. They were scrambling to connect with a 3PL and have had issues with the current 3PL they selected. The software is quite old and they struggle to connect seamlessly with Hero Forges custom API. They would like to have a partner that can manipulate their own internal WMS / IMS platform to fit the needs of the brand, and has solid API documentation for Hero Forge's full-time dev team to be able to work with as well.

The current fulfillment processes involves a typical inbound shipment of 100-500 miniatures from the manufacturers based in Netherlands, India, and parts of the US. The 3PL will receive, inspect the box (each has a unique identifier on the barcodes) for damages, and then sort to be packed and shipped (typically on the same day). If damages to the box, send back to the manufacturer.

Before the issue with original 3PL, target turnaround times were 4 weeks from order to production, to internal shipment, then final shipment to user - but 9x out of 10 would beat that.",Dan from fulfill making the intro this week.,,Platinum,https://www.heroforge.com/,10000.0,,Fulfill,2024-08-15 08:52:00,

Here is our overview

 

We import containers of premium adult diapers from Italy and sell them DTC via Shopify and Amazon

We also source FTL and LTL from domestic suppliers to round out our DTC offering (they are located in NC and NJ)

We broke our model (via growth) with Cardinal Health in 2023 and were forced to find a 3P solution in 2024‚Ä¶.we went with ShipBob for their ecommerce / DTC chops and global movement of goods

Unfortunately, their model (using real time bidding and a bevy of carriers) has a less than optimal service level for DTC Fulfillment (their importing, intranode, spin up of new DCs has been flawless)

About 5% of our orders are failing (not shipped, not tracking, not delivered in 1 to 4 business days)‚Ä¶.when Aunt Edna needs her diapers, she needs them in a timely fashion.

Our business is built on growing our reoccurring revenue base‚Ä¶.our nectar customers order like clockwork every 4 ‚Äì 6 weeks‚Ä¶our CLTV is around $3500 before the big opt out (death, hospice, etc)

 

DTC Fulfillment

8000 orders per month ‚Äì rising to 10,000 per month over the summer as we grow
No seasonality
Geo breakdown
34% Northeast
20% West Coast
20% Southeast
14% Midwest
13% Southwest
 

Import Processing

8 ‚Äì 10 containers per month from Italy
Floor loaded for max yield, we can do slipsheets
1 FTL every other month (from NC)
1 LTL every month ( from NJ)
 

Intranode

We orient to the East Coast (shipments from Italy) and try to ship in bulk to where our customers live
Pending the intranode network, we would ship into the East Coast preferably, but have to account for getting goods to the West Coast
Most proposals have a footprint of 3 to 5 fulfillment centers strategically located across the US ‚Äì with an east coast bias
 

Rework / Big Picks

Our Italian mfgr / owner has autohandling carousels coming off of their mfgr lines.  These are all oriented to an EU pallet.  So we import 6 bags/carton.
We retail our cartons as 4X per carton
Shipbob treats this as one big pick‚Ä¶..not without a painpoint‚Ä¶.invariably, these big picks get put into too large a carton‚Ä¶and we pay for it in fulfillment cost
We are moving to 4x imports asap ‚Äì but there will be some hangover stock to deal with
 

Big n Bulky Stuff

Our stuff is big n bulky
Average case (bestseller) is something like 20 x 14 x 12 and 18 lbs
So competitive DIMs and storage is a necessity
 

We are motivated to find the right partner and quickly‚Ä¶.we simply cannot operate our business with a 5% order failure rate.

current DC in Georgia - huge warehouse and fulfillment team but looking to move to a 3PL
originally thinking 1 DC on each coast - now they ONLY want 1 DC in East Coast
Serve shopify, amazon d2c, walmart, target, etc
having it in house is not very efficient, they are not experts in fulfillment for d2c.
wanting experts to handle d2c, realizing it may cost a bit more but still mindful of margins
not worked w US 3PLs yet - in pakistan yes. they started outreaching to some US 3PLs, but
their proposals are around 40% of costs so its too high - seems like they didnt get the right type of proposals?
Confused by proposal types so looking to have this standardized/formatted 
separating all costs adds up to much - need transparency on costs
requirements: REP: Navision by microsfot - need to integrate (marketplace orders come in thru ERP)

Jamie Kay,Cold,John Allen,"
Location Preference: Australia and North America (can be US or Canada but it will depends on serviceability and cost) - would be for the North American volume
DTC Monthly Order Volume: Looking at 2 locations for 3PLs. One is in Australia and the other to cover North America (Canada and United States).
Average 7,000 orders per month from Shopify in Australia. There is an average of 7 units per order.
Average 6,500 orders per month from Shopify in North America. This is an average of 8 units per order.
Higher peaks around Black Friday and collection launches (we do 1 collection launch per month)
B2B + Retail Monthly Order Volume: Typically ship cases to boutique children stores in Australia and North America. The volume differs depending on requirement of the stores.
In North Amercia, averaging around 60 B2B orders per month with around 100 units per order.
In Australia, averaging around 100 B2B orders per month with around 70 units per order.
Looking to get into larger format retailers so will be looking in larger quantities in the future.
SKUs: over 30,000 SKUs but the nature of their product means they hardly repeat order. They work on always creating new designs and products and launch around 3,000 SKUs per month.
Other ranges of toys (90 SKUs) and nappies (9 SKUs) are smaller and will have repeat orders when stock run low
Storage Requirement: around 300-500 pallets of bulk inventory for each region. Clothing and Toys can be mixed cartons but nappies will be 1 SKU per pallet.
However, there will likely need to be around 6,000-10,000 bins to allow for efficient picking of clothing items.
Products they are shipping: Shipping children apparel and related products. This includes toys and nappies. Predominantly children clothing.
Specialty Storage or Packaging Needs: Ship in their own branded courier bags which they can supply. There is no specific requirements for shipping in boxes. They would use courier company boxes such as DHL or Fedex for larger orders.
Current Fulfillment Situation: Currently fulfill from their own DC in New Zealand to service worldwide. They are looking to expand so they can service their 2 core regions better and also reduce cost of fulfillment.
Timeline: This would be a big move for them so it will be around the second half of 2025.
Additional Information: Speed and reliability are important factors to them on top of costs.
They have recently acquired 3 other brands as well that would lead to these volumes and expansions too.",fulfill to re-engage next week,,Gold,https://www.jamiekay.com,6500.0,,Internal,2024-11-15 13:51:00,

Crc Industries,Cold,John Allen,"
Location Preference: Open to location - manufacturer of their own products and they are located in Pennsylvania.

DTC Monthly Order Volume:  Amazon FBM - about < 5% of business but around 6,000 orders of mostly single cans

B2B + Retail Monthly Order Volume: Ship an average of 50k cases a month to Amazon fulfillment centers

SKUs: They have just over 500 ASINs with forecasted sales over the next 47 weeks.

Storage Requirement: Their current pricing set up is inclusive of storage so they don't know exactly how much is on hand. The 3PL has been managing ordering inventory as well.

Products they are shipping: Primarily aerosol MRO chemicals in 11-20 oz cans plus 32 oz - 1 gal bottles and some 5 gal pails

Specialty Storage or Packaging Needs: Many products with various degrees of hazmat designation. Their top moving item requires prep-bagging and is currently only supplied FBM because of this.

Current Fulfillment Situation: use a 3PL company in Chicago to warehouse and ship products and they also handle their marketing, AMS, content generation, invoicing and customer service. They are unable to keep up with the growth and their VM is not happy with their acceptance rate.

Timeline: Q1-Q2 of 2025

Additional Information: Many of their products are $5-20 per unit price range but strong margins with Amazon. They list each as well as case pack variations for most of their products. 50% of units sold is within 19 ASINs, 30% is in top 3 ASINs. They have been part of Vendor Central for over 12 years and have a Vendor Manager in the BIS category.

Ice Barrel,Cold,John Allen,"1. What product(s) will you be shipping? Cold plunge ice barrels weighing anywhere from 50-105 lbs when empty
2. How many SKUs? 3 core SKUs with ~ 20 accessories, replacement parts, etc
3. Ideal warehouse location(s)? Open to locations in the Midwest, Southeast, and Central US. Will likely need at least two warehouse nodes. Want to avoid high cost areas like CA, OR, Chicago, NYC, Miami, etc
4. Special storage or packaging needs?
5. Monthly Order volume? Ice Barrel sells across 5 main channels - DTC, Dropship, Amazon (FBA and FBM), Big Box Retail, and Miscellaneous Wholesale shipment. Across the channels, they do an average of 3,700 total shipments per month. Estimates by channel:
DTC - 500-750 total shipments
Amazon (not as many barrels, more accessories) - 400 total shipments
Dealers - 100 shipments
Retail - the remaining balance of shipments are done on a quarterly basis amongst big box retailers
Miscellaneous - events (Crossfit games), influencer shipments, etc and these are inconsistent / bi-annual. For example, they are the official cold therapy partner of crossfit games and ship 80 ice barrels to the games 2x a year
6. Storage requirements? Since they are currently self-fulfilling they are largely doing just in time fulfillment / stock management for the barrels. Keep about 6 months of inventory on hand for accessories. They essentially manufacture to order, with a few hundred units coming in and going out each week.
7. Timeline to find a new 3PL? Ideal state would be to start with a 3PL by Q4 (or at least begin phasing this in) and then expand to total use of a 3PL over time. They are also open to fully transitioning to a 3PL up front. Their target is Q4, but will be ok with Q1 timeframe if needed to find the right partner
Additional Notes:
- Have currently grown the business to this point building in-house out of Ohio warehouse, but expect to 3x the business by this time next year which is not scalable with their current warehousing
- Do not want to be in a facility that has other cold therapy products, this is non negotiable for them
- Looking to be more efficient from an opex perspective, along with the strategic placement of their stock
- Shipping about 15-20 units a month to Canada right now as well

Location Preference: Kentucky or nearby. Current 3PL in KY and seems to be an ideal spot. Has brick and mortar locations in TX
DTC Monthly Order Volume: 3k-3500 per month - Shopify
B2B + Retail Monthly Order Volume: ships B2B to owner's own Brick and Mortar stores in Houston and Dallas, TX
SKUs: over 1k SKUs - consistent
Storage Requirement: will need to find out requirement from current 3PL
Products they are shipping: wigs and extensions
Specialty Storage or Packaging: There will be some kitting with putting the hair into bags.
**Pre Kit requirement - some SKUs need to lay flat and CANNOT be kitted until they are packaged for shipment.
Current Fulfillment Situation: using a 3PL in KY (have been for 10 years) with very outdated to no technology and it has been causing increased headaches
Timeline: owner would like to vet the technology but estimating 3-4 months to pack up all current inventory. Would like to do a test run prior to.
Additional: Capability to do Amazon Prime SFP would be nice. They do not sell on Amazon at the moment but exploring it
Shopify - clear API and documentation to build own connector. I do not think the owner knows how standard a Shopify integration is based on hearing about their experience with their current 3PL.

hey currently have super low storage with their current 3PL. They pay a flat fee for 10k per year but they have been there for so long. He doesn't expect that but obviously this still has to be financial viable for them. ",Working on pricing based PLD.

As soon as they find a good 3PL partner, they look to grow the US based DTC to 2k-2.5k+ per month. They would get it ironed out with the 3PL and then look to bring their other, larger brand, Lighthouse Clothing, to the US as well.

They are open to WMS that is solid/internal but needs to be constantly updated, have internal tech team that are attentive.
Need to be good at high sku counts.

Fulfillment Setup	We currently handle fulfillment in-house at our warehouse. Our team manages inventory, packing, and shipping directly. While this allows us to maintain control over the process, we face challenges with order accuracy and scaling to meet higher order volumes during peak seasons.

When To Switch	
We are exploring options but are open to switching within the next few months if we find the right partner that can help us improve efficiency and accuracy.

Anything Else to Know	
We prioritize fast and accurate order fulfillment to maintain customer satisfaction. We‚Äôre interested in solutions that can integrate smoothly with our current operations and provide better scalability as we grow.",Barry and John to meet 2/26,checked,Unknown,https://www.5ivepillars.com/,1000.0,,3Peel,2025-02-26 09:31:00,
Accelerate360,Current Customer,John Allen,3Pl and Agency that focuses on magazines looking for help with a new client,"Mike got a contract back to him and we got edits back to them. He then called and we discussed - should be no issue on insurance piece and he agrees that part on recall is ridiculous and not necessary. 45 day terms is a deal breaker for them and thats best they can do (they are at 60 days with current client so said anything under 45 days would simply be a show stopper for them). 

All the pallets will becoming from them and will be pre-palletized. We originally went to them and told them it would be $20 a pallet to unload and $20 a pallet to send it out. So they came back with wanting $10 a pallet for storage and $1 a pallet for unload and unload. After talking with it with Barry and Nate we think we should go back to them with $5.

Lucid Candle,Pricing Discussion,John Allen,"Industry/types of item(s)? candles

Ecommerce platform? shopify

Current pain points? Ideal setup?
brand used to be part of a larger company - recently owner broke off and purchased just the candle portion. that old parent Co is still manufacturing and warehousing/fulfillment just for him. wants to work with a 3PL who is actually specialized in the 3PL side (rather than working thru mnfr)

shopping for what other options are -
balance between costs and customer support important - items are correct and sent to customer without quality
but doesn't want to kill margins
substantial customer base in wedding/event industry - they ask for rush orders frequently.
a 3pl that can assist with these types of rush orders (picked and shipped within 1 business day) would be necessary
it's what they are used to now. 3pm ET cut off time is current
ground orders go out within 1 business day. and expedited shipping gets out quickly.

returns - any used products would need some refurbishing (at production facility) so wont go to 3PL

ideally easy to integrate into shopify +communication 1:1 with anyone needed

Desired warehouse location(s) open to anywhere

Do you have strict temperature requirements?

no, no hazmat (combustable NOT flammable liquid goes into the candles)
SDS available

How many different SKUs? 130 - but could decrease

Monthly sales number B2B? (orders) a few bulk orders but not main focus (event industry)

Monthly sales B2C? (orders) 1000 (higher in q4)

When are you looking to move to a new 3pl? before q3 starts 2025

DTC Monthly Order Volume: Shopify 80-100 and expect it to grow. AMZ 200-300 and expect it to grow. Currently a handful of AMZ orders are fulfilled by my 3PL and utilizing FBA for the majority of AMZ orders. I would ultimately like to fulfill all AMZ orders via my 3PL but the prices would need to be competitive with AMZ in order to do so. B2B + Retail Monthly Order Volume: B2B is not very intensive - mostly to Yoga Studios - an avg B2B order is 8-14 units. I send 300-500 units every couple months to Amazon FBA SKUs: Currently 260 SKU. There are only a handful of actual styles (maybe 8) but as it is clothing there are size and color variations. The # of SKUs will come down as inventory sells off as we are merging two brands and streamlining our product offering moving forward. Storage Requirement: I am not sure how many pallets - I currently utilize 600-700 CuFt of storage space - I would guess this equates to about 4-5 larger Pallets Products they are shipping: apparel generally 1-2 units 15oz-2LB soft mailer 10x13x.5 Specialty Storage or Packaging Needs: Not really - I sell clothing - just that the goods remain clean/new. I used a warehouse once and there was a lot of soot everywhere and it would get all over the cartons etc which was problematic Current Fulfillment Situation: I have a 3PL provider in Dallas. They provide good service however; the pick fee and return processing fees I was quoted prior to moving there are not what I was promised. For example in Q4 they DOUBLE their storage fee which is just too much for me. Also, I find their invoices and 3PL software not so user friendly and I am spending too much time reconciling the invoices each month Timeline: 30-45 days",Customer passed as they did not want to pay an additional charge to steam returns,,Bronze,Yogacrow.com,500.0,,Internal,2024-04-24 08:27:00,

Olive,Current Customer,John Allen,"Background: Oliv√© is a personal care brand selling 100% all natural olive oil products such as soaps, bodywash, shampoo and more. It is great for people with eczema, great for babies, and general skin / body health. It is all natural and made from a 1,000 year old traditional recipe in Syria that has not yet been introduced to the US market.

The brand has been founded and financed from 6 cousins originally from Syria with a variety of professional backgrounds. The woman spearheading the brand has a 30 year career in marketing, with a passion for creative and branding. She has brought many products to market and is very well versed in creative and advertising.

The brand is based on their heritage and unlike many ""family-owned"" companies is truly a collection of 6 cousins working together on something they are passionate about. The company tagline is ""from our family to yours"".

The family have spent over 60k on samples and packaging to really nail the branding and product, and have had to work through many setbacks to bring this product to market. There have been complications producing in Syria (such as the manufacturing factories being bombed mid production), yet they have still pushed through!

1. What product(s) will you be shipping? Line of personal care products, made from 100% all natural olive oil. Bodywash, soaps, shampoo, conditioner, facemasks

Additional Notes:
Brand Bolt owns and operates 4 separate health, wellness and beauty brands. They currently fulfill from their manufacturer in Tennessee area to the East Coast, and worked with Fulfill to find a partner for their West Coast orders earlier this year (approx 15k orders. a month).
The scope is relatively simple, so their CEO did ask if I could supply him with a basic rate card (pick and pack primarily) when making my recommendation, just so he can have a high level understanding of costs from the beginning.
If your carrier rates are more competitive than what he currently has, he will want to use your rates, otherwise he would want to supply his own. I understand this may be a disqualifer if they do not use your rates, which is why we are asking for this detail in advance as well, so we can ensure it is a worthwhile introduction for you.

Dan said this would be won by the cheapest pick / pack almost assuredly",Fulfill re-engaging next week,,Platinum,www..brandbolt.co,1500.0,Pricing for Brand Bolt (1).docx (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/40/40/1744178400000/FqQS80m9n5yZCM-6wYKggw/SUATAX4XOlFlzoe7d2EZRBCfW7SYxXt_yW49VLAdlIIYLQlhc7S7-y-x9jkqxURI86_T-3nYVrWz2pTsC2TBJKnmRhxLOBSWoCnlZMFEsoa9mLryk1L3VPg38L4ttnvbXtvIFUuaOAaKacqLuOH9Y7IZefPgeuW_P9QxTgdRLIs/uxljYhqRAPSLeg4cQrKJe-HF9V2dxwc6yj4T-5qkJpE),Fulfill,2024-10-24 07:44:00,
